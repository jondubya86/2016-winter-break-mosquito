			<p>I am currently enrolled in a full-stack web development course within Coalition for Queens (C4Q). This is a fun little project I worked on during my time in the fellowship. Zika Attack is my first personal full-stack project integrating Sequel databases, Sequelize, Canvas, and React. It is not perfect but it's been a great personal test to encompass all I have learned during my time there. </p>
			<p>My inspiration for this little game is due to the outbreak of the Zika epidemic during the summer of 2016. The issue is no laughing matter but I assumed a game would be a great way to sink in the Zika name for kids and the uninformed. The first step of prevention is to have knowledge of the issue at hand.</p>
			<p>Please refer to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus'>Wikipedia</a> page of the causes, symptoms, and preventative measures you can take to keep you and your loved ones safe. Also please donate to non-profit organizations who are in the front line to combat this epidemic like <a href='http://www.msf.org/'>Doctors Without Borders</a> (Médecins Sans Frontières).</p>
			<p>Keep calm and swat on!</p>
